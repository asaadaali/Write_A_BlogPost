## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All the necessary libraries to run the code were installed here. These include libraries pandas and numpy. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. Which gender is dominant in the industry?

2. Which country produces more developers?

3. Are salary and job satisfaction correlated?

All files of this project are a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project. 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook follows the CRISP-DM model.

## Data Cleaning <a name="data cleaning"></a>

The Stack Overflow 2017 data has quality issues. Markdown cells and comments were added to explain the data cleaning and preprocessing steps used during analysis.   

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@asaadaali/can-you-make-tons-of-money-by-learning-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-aa8b0adf054e).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
